| [Labyrinthia](Labyrinthia)            	| A prototype roguelite test game containing the assembled building blocks for 2D character control, shooting, map generation and prop placement. 	| [Play it here!](https://shockwave20599.itch.io/labyrinthia)            	|
| [RogueVenture](RogueVenture)          	| A polished version of [Labyrinthia](Labyrinthia), submitted to [Kenney Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2023/rate/2183379).                 	| [Play it here!](https://shockwave20599.itch.io/rogue-venture)          	|
| [2D Shooter](2D%20Shooter)          	| A basic implementation of a 2D character controller with a shooting mechanic. Also contains many tweening add-ons that polish the shooting experience                 	| -          	|
| [Procedural Generation 2D](Utils/Procedural%20Generation%202D/)          	| A barebones procedural map generator that allows the user to generate map floors using a choice of two different algorithms - Random Walk and Binary Space Partitioning. Also contains a procedural prop placer that uses Dijkstra's algorithm for spawning pickups based on distance from player.             	| -          	|
| [Third Person Controller](Utils/Third%20Person%20Controller/)          	| A basic third person controller template with added aiming and shooting mechanics.            	| -          	|
| [Unity Input System](Utils/Unity%20Input%20System/)          	| A basic template project that employs the Unity's new input system package. Used as a test project for different inputs.             	| -          	|
